[{"id":0,"href":"/about/","title":"About","section":"Home","content":" About # Course Description # This course covers the basics of setting up and administering a production-quality Linux server environment. By the end of this course, we expect that you will\u0026hellip;\nbe comfortable using GNU/Linux understand how different parts of the OS work together, e.g. init, processes, daemons, filesystems, etc. understand basic networking on Linux have a good sense about maintaining system security understand system administration essentials get a practical taste of what sysadmins do in industry. While we expect many students will have a CS background, the only real prerequisite is a desire to learn about new and unfamiliar technologies, which is a critical skill for sysadmins. This course is designed to introduce new users to Linux, as well as give more experienced users a taste of what Linux is capable of!\nAdministrivia # Enrollment # This is a 2 unit DeCal. Since it is a DeCal, the course is P/NP. You must complete Lab 0 to apply. If you are selected for the course, we will send you a course enrollment code.\nCommunication # Official course communications will primarily be sent via email (through Ed announcements), and mirrored on the front page of the course website.\nThere are several ways you can get in contact with course facilitators:\nMake a post on Ed. (best for conceptual/debugging/content help) Send a message to #decal-general (or as a private message to a facilitator) either on Slack or Discord. (best for realtime communications) Email decal@ocf.berkeley.edu. (best for prospective students and matters that need to go on official record) Lecture # Lectures for this course are synchronous (see the weekly schedule on the home page for the time and location). We will do our best to provide recordings at the beginning of each week as well. There will be 10 total required lectures for each track, as well as one optional guest lecture.\nA short participation assignment (vitamin) will be released every week with some questions to check your understanding on lecture and reading. We require 5 out of 10 of the vitamins to be completed, and if you compete all 10, we will grant you 1 lab drop.\nLab Assignments # The primary assignment in this course will be weekly lab work. Labs are designed to be be significantly hands-on. You will be working on real systems, configuring and fixing things, setting up services, and so on.\nEach lecture corresponds with a lab and will be releasedon Sundays.\nEach lab will be due by the Saturday, 11:59pm PST after the lab section unless otherwise stated.\nYou must complete 10 labs to receive credit for taking the course. The late due date for labs is 2 weeks after the original due date. You may submit up to 2 labs late throughout the semester without penalty.\nIf you need to request an excused lab extension or drop, please fill out this form. Doing so will not affect your two unexcused late labs.\nYou are highly encouraged to look over the lab, and try to start it, before coming to live lab sections each week. This will allow you to better utilize the help of the facilitators.\nLive Labs # During lab sections, facilitators will be able to give additional information, and hold office hours to answer any questions that may arise. Lab sections will be held in the OCF lab (171 MLK, click here for directions).\nGrading # The following are required to receive credit for the course:\n10 completed lab assignments Lab assignments are graded on completion, not correctness. Blank or otherwise extremely low-effort submissions (i.e. no visible attempt at answering the questions asked) will be considered incomplete. At least 5 completed participation assignments (vitamins) If you complete all 10 of the vitamins, we will grant you 1 lab drop. FAQ # Will the DeCal be offered next semester? # Most likely. We are aiming to offer the decal every semester! You can check announcements or reach out to the decal committee over discord/slack.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want units / wasn\u0026rsquo;t accepted / am not a student. Can I audit this course? # We are working hard to get all of our materials online this semester for everyone to access! Feel free to view our lectures or complete any of the labs on your own. (You will need your own Linux VM though- you can install one locally or get one from a provider such as DigitalOcean.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m stuck on a lab/concept! Where can I find help? # The best way to get support with course content is to ask during scheduled lab times. If you need help at another time, feel free to ask on Ed, on our Slack channel at #decal-general, or on our Discord channel. Logistics questions are best suited for email ( decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).\nI have another question! # Email us at decal@ocf.berkeley.edu.\nAfter this Course # There\u0026rsquo;s no substitute for real-world experience. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get experience in a low-risk but real-world setting, consider joining the OCF as a volunteer staff member. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to put the things you learn in this course to use, and help other students while you\u0026rsquo;re at it. Best of all- there\u0026rsquo;s no application process! Just drop by and say hi :)\nWeekly staff meetings are held Wednesdays at 8pm at the OCF lab.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/1/","title":"Lab 1 - Unix, the Shell, OSS","section":"Home","content":" Table of contents # {: .no_toc .text-delta }\nTOC {:toc} Introduction # Welcome to the first lab!\nAll labs are graded on completeness and effort, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about getting an exact right answer. (We\u0026rsquo;ll release staff solutions after the lab is due!)\nLabs are also usually due a week from when they are assigned. Remember to ask for help if you need it on Edstem or Discord/Slack!\nIt may be convenient to submit your answers to Gradescope as you go.\nPro Tips:\nHere are some commands you might find helpful: vim, ls, cd, man, file, grep, cat, less, wget, nano, tar, ..., (and other inferior text editors) Google and man are your friends! Part 1: Shell spelunking # Everything should be done via the shell!\nThe purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable with using the shell for things you might typically use a GUI for. While these tasks may seem simplistic or limited, you\u0026rsquo;ll quickly find that the commands have many different options (flags) to perform tasks that are either impossible or incredibly tedious / difficult to complete using traditional methods.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry about fully understanding how the commands work just yet- as long as you can gain a sense of familiarity with the tools at hand, we\u0026rsquo;ll be in good shape to explore them further next week!\nssh into tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu using your OCF account, or login at ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu\nRun the following command to download the file we have provided: wget https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs/raw/master/b1/b01.tgz\nA .tgz file is actually a composition of two file formats. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll see these files as .tar.gz instead. A common (and old) way of archiving is with magnetic tapes. However, in order to archive the data, it needs to be a single file, and often you want to archive multiple files at once. This is where the tar command comes in (tar stands for tape archive). Tar will group (or ungroup) multiple files into a single one.\ntar, unless you ask it to, doesn\u0026rsquo;t compress files itself though. This is where either gzip (or bzip2) comes in. gzip will compress your file, and so, tar + gzip is often used in conjunction. It looks something like this: file --(tar)--\u0026gt; file.tar --(gzip)--\u0026gt; file.tar.gz.\nIf you read the tar documentation carefully enough, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that you can give the command an option to compress your files using gzip as well, saving you a total of one line of shell command!\nTo unarchive the file we provide you, run the following command: tar xvzf b01.tgz. This will provide a b01 directory for you with some files for the rest of this lab.\ntar has a reputation for being a bit tricky with its options: Go into the b01 directory. Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re in there by running pwd (Present working directory). What does pwd give you (conceptually)?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a hidden file in the b01 directory. What is the secret?\nA malicious user made its way into my computer and created a message split across all the files in nonsense/. What does it say? How did you find the message?\nGo ahead and delete everything in nonsense/ with one command. How did you do it?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a file in b01 called big_data.txt. It\u0026rsquo;s 80 megabytes worth of random text. For reference, Leo Tolstoy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;War and Peace\u0026rdquo;, the novel with a whopping 57,287 words depicting the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families with several chapters solely dedicated to philosophical prose, is only 3.2 megabytes large.\nFor that reason, I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend using cat to print the file. You can try it, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be sitting there for a while. There\u0026rsquo;s some text you need to find in there! Go find it without actually opening up the file itself!\nTwo lines above the only URL in the file is a secret solution. What is that solution?\nHints: What makes up a URL (https\u0026hellip;)? What is Context Line Control?\nTry executing ./a_script. You should get something back that says permission denied: ./a_script. This is because files have three different permissions: read, write, and execute. Which one does a_script need? Change the file permissions so that you can run the script. How did you do it?\nFinally, there\u0026rsquo;s an empty file called hello_world in the directory. Write your name in it! How did you do it?\nPart 2: General Questions # Feel free to use Google and work in a terminal (where applicable) to verify your conjectures.\nWhat differentiates Linux/OSX from operating systems like Windows?\nWhat are some differences between the command line and normal (graphical) usage of an OS?\nWhat is the root directory in Linux filesystems? Answer conceptually, as in depth as you would like,\nls has a lot of cool arguments. Try using them to get extra information such as file permissions, owner name, owner group, file size, and late date edited. In addition, I want to be able to see the size and have the files ordered by last date edited, with the oldest files on top. How would I do this?\nInstead of showing the first 10 lines of the file big_data.txt, I want to use the head command to show the first 4. How would I do that?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the difference between cat foo \u0026gt; out.txt and cat foo \u0026gt;\u0026gt; out.txt?\nBriefly, what is the difference between permissive and copyleft licenses?\nGive an example of a permissive license.\nGive an example of (a) open-source software and (b) free, but closed-source software that you use.\nPart 3: Obtaining your VM # Using the public OCF login server will allow you to do basic things like the lab above, but if you want root permission (which lets you do basically whatever you want), you\u0026rsquo;ll need your own use/destroy!\nWe will be providing a virtual machine (VM) to all DeCal students with a Berkeley CalNet account. Check your @berkeley.edu email!\nIf you are not a Berkeley student, then you will have to obtain your own machine. Of course, you can also set up your own VM if you are just curious. Generally, there are two ways to obtain a VM: use your own computer (local) or use someone else\u0026rsquo;s computer (cloud).\nLocal Setups: # Virtual Box UTM - Only for MacOS Cloud Setups: # These are usually paid services, but if you have a student email, they provide more than enough free credits for the purposes of this course.\nDigital Ocean GCP Azure "},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/my-first-post/","title":"Week 0 Announcement","section":"Posts","content":" The Linux SysAdmin Decal is back for Spring 2025!
