By the end of this course, we expect that you will\u0026hellip;\nbe comfortable using GNU/Linux understand how different parts of the OS work together, e.g. init, processes, daemons, filesystems, etc. understand basic networking on Linux have a good sense about maintaining system security understand system administration essentials get a practical taste of what sysadmins do in industry. While we expect many students will have a CS background, the only real prerequisite is a desire to learn about new and unfamiliar technologies, which is a critical skill for sysadmins. This course is designed to introduce new users to Linux, as well as give more experienced users a taste of what Linux is capable of!\nAdministrivia # Enrollment # This is a 2 unit DeCal. Since it is a DeCal, the course is P/NP. You must complete Lab 0 to apply. If you are selected for the course, we will send you a course enrollment code.\nCommunication # Official course communications will primarily be sent via email (through Ed announcements), and mirrored on the front page of the course website.\nThere are several ways you can get in contact with course facilitators:\nMake a post on Ed. (best for conceptual/debugging/content help) Send a message to #decal-general (or as a private message to a facilitator) either on Slack or Discord. (best for realtime communications) Email decal@ocf.berkeley.edu. (best for prospective students and matters that need to go on official record) Lecture # Lectures for this course are synchronous (see the weekly schedule on the home page for the time and location). We will do our best to provide recordings at the beginning of each week as well. There will be 10 total required lectures for each track, as well as one optional guest lecture.\nA short participation assignment (vitamin) will be released every week with some questions to check your understanding on lecture and reading. We require 5 out of 10 of the vitamins to be completed, and if you compete all 10, we will grant you 1 lab drop.\nLab Assignments # The primary assignment in this course will be weekly lab work. Labs are designed to be be significantly hands-on. You will be working on real systems, configuring and fixing things, setting up services, and so on.\nEach lecture corresponds with a lab and will be releasedon Sundays.\nEach lab will be due by the Saturday, 11:59pm PST after the lab section unless otherwise stated.\nYou must complete 10 labs to receive credit for taking the course. The late due date for labs is 2 weeks after the original due date. You may submit up to 2 labs late throughout the semester without penalty.\nIf you need to request an excused lab extension or drop, please fill out this form. Doing so will not affect your two unexcused late labs.\nYou are highly encouraged to look over the lab, and try to start it, before coming to live lab sections each week. This will allow you to better utilize the help of the facilitators.\nLive Labs # During lab sections, facilitators will be able to give additional information, and hold office hours to answer any questions that may arise. Lab sections will be held in the OCF lab (171 MLK, click here for directions).\nGrading # The following are required to receive credit for the course:\n10 completed lab assignments Lab assignments are graded on completion, not correctness. Blank or otherwise extremely low-effort submissions (i.e. no visible attempt at answering the questions asked) will be considered incomplete. At least 5 completed participation assignments (vitamins) If you complete all 10 of the vitamins, we will grant you 1 lab drop. FAQ # Will the DeCal be offered next semester? # Most likely. We are aiming to offer the decal every semester! You can check announcements or reach out to the decal committee over discord/slack.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want units / wasn\u0026rsquo;t accepted / am not a student. Can I audit this course? # We are working hard to get all of our materials online this semester for everyone to access! Feel free to view our lectures or complete any of the labs on your own. (You will need your own Linux VM though- you can install one locally or get one from a provider such as DigitalOcean.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m stuck on a lab/concept! Where can I find help? # The best way to get support with course content is to ask during scheduled lab times. If you need help at another time, feel free to ask on Ed, on our Slack channel at #decal-general, or on our Discord channel. Logistics questions are best suited for email ( decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).\nI have another question! # Email us at decal@ocf.berkeley.edu.\nAfter this Course # There\u0026rsquo;s no substitute for real-world experience. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get experience in a low-risk but real-world setting, consider joining the OCF as a volunteer staff member. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to put the things you learn in this course to use, and help other students while you\u0026rsquo;re at it. Best of all- there\u0026rsquo;s no application process!

All of this configuration can be successfully done without a Minecraft client or knowledge on how to play the game itself.\nIf you want to actually be able to connect to the server: If you\u0026rsquo;re not using the provided VM make sure your Linux VM has enough RAM to host the server (2-4Gb).\nGetting help # If you want any help with any part of this lab, join the OCF Discord ( https://ocf.io/discord) and ask in the #decal-general channel!\nThe original creator of this lab is Frank Dai (fydai), and there was originally a message here telling you to ping him if you needed any help. You are still welcome to try (or, you can also ping current decal facilitators as well) :)\nThe most important trick with puppet # If you mess anything up, delete everything (in particular /home/minecraft), and just run puppet again! Puppet ensures that even starting from nothing, you can reconstruct your entire previous state. If you do this and get issues with Puppet executing things out of order than you would like them, add in a require parameter to the resource that should be defined later. For instance, if you want to create something after the /home/minecraft directory, throw in an require =\u0026gt; File['/home/minecraft'] option. In general, capitalize the name of the resource, and put the string before the colon between the square braces.\nPart 1: Installing Puppet # First, we’re going to install Puppet.\nsudo apt install puppet If you installed puppet with an earlier version of the lab and it isn\u0026rsquo;t working, please use the command below and then install puppet with apt.\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/puppet_5.5.22-4ubuntu0.2_all.deb Part 2: Using Puppet # Make a minecraft.pp file anywhere, which through the course of this lab, will eventually configure and run a Minecraft Server. To run your puppet code, use sudo puppet apply minecraft.pp. Puppet, being declarative, will do nothing if the system is already configured properly, so run puppet early and often to detect bugs as soon as possible.\nUseful references are this section are the Puppet documentation and there is a lot of sample code avaliable in the OCF Puppet configuration. When you are stuck, looking at existing code and see how they did things will generally be helpful. Also remember that there are code examples on the slides!\nPart a: Making a Home Directory and a User # Put the following code into minecraft.pp:\nfile { \u0026#39;/home/minecraft\u0026#39;: ensure =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;directory\u0026#39;, } Run sudo puppet apply minecraft.pp to apply it, and ensure that the /home/minecraft directory was created.\nInside minecraft.pp, write some Puppet code to create a user named minecraft, that the Minecraft server will run under. The minecraft user should have home directory /home/minecraft. Now modify the code creating /home/minecraft to set owner the owner to minecraft user you just made. Check the example code on the slides if you are unsure about how to do this.\nChecking Part a # Run sudo puppet apply minecraft.pp.\nNow run ls -l /home and verify that /home/minecraft is owned by the minecraft user.\nPart b: Install java # Add a few lines to minecraft.pp to install the default-jre package.\nChecking Part 2b # Run java and verify that the binary exists.\nPart c: Installing the Minecraft Server configuration # Copy paste the contents of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xcf/decal-labs/master/a10/server.properties locally into a file named server.properties\nEnsure that /home/minecraft/server.properties contains the contents of the server.properties you just saved.\nHint: Use the file function! Also note that in this lab, you should be using absolute file paths.\nRead and agree to the Minecraft EULA, and ensure that /home/minecraft/eula.txt contains the text eula=true by hardcoding the string eula=true into your minecraft.pp.\nMake sure that all of the above files are owned by the minecraft user.\nChecking Part c # Run ls -l /home/minecraft and ensure that the above files exist, contain what they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to, and they are all owned by the minecraft user, not yours.\nPart d: Installing the Minecraft Server # Ensure that /home/minecraft/server.jar contains the Minecraft Server, available at https://piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/1b557e7b033b583cd9f66746b7a9ab1ec1673ced/server.jar. This server jar is for Minecraft 1.16.5, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to run a different version you can download the jar from within the Minecraft launcher or from the Minecraft wiki.\nNote that the source parameter of the file resource accepts a URL as its argument. Also make it owned by the minecraft user.\nChecking Part d # You know what to do!\nPart e: Templating a systemd unit file # Copy the following template into the same directory into your minecraft.pp file as minecraft.service.erb.\nEdit the file to be a proper erb template, so that \u0026lt;INSERT YOUR RAM AMOUNT HERE\u0026gt; becomes the value of the memory_available variable when puppet runs. You want to use the templated variable @memory_available in the .erb file, and declare the variable $memory_available it in the .pp file.\nHint: In the slides), there is an example of templating a file.\nHint 2: A .erb (Embedded Ruby) file means that Ruby is used as the templating language instead of the puppet language. Make sure not to confuse the syntax between the two!\nNow edit your minecraft.pp file, so that it sets the $memory_available variable to be the half the total amount of RAM available to the system (use Google and StackOverflow), and that it puts the templated file into /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service.\nHint: You need to figure out how to define variables and set variables in puppet. Note that variables should be prefixed by $. You can assign variables just like any other language. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to look at the sample code on the slides (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover variable assignment however) and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use absolute paths!\nNote that the systemd unit file does not have a proper ExecStop, which maybe result in some world corruption.\n[Unit] Description=Minecraft Server Wants=network.target After=network.target [Service] User=minecraft WorkingDirectory=/home/minecraft # This should look like ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xmx504578 -jar server.jar ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xmx\u0026lt;INSERT YOUR RAM AMOUNT HERE\u0026gt; -jar server.jar ExecStop=/bin/kill -- $MAINPID TimeoutStopSec=5 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Checking Part e # Look at /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service to ensure it contains the contents you want before proceeding.\nPart f: Running the service # Ensure that the minecraft systemd service is enabled and started.\nChecking Part f # This is the critical moment! If you\u0026rsquo;ve done everything before correctly, this should work (until Minecraft OOMs)! If the systemd unit fails immediately, try to run the ExecStart command manually, by going into /home/minecraft/ and running sudo -u minecraft java -Xmx1009156 -jar server.jar.\nYou can verify that something is trying to start by running tail -f /home/minecraft/logs/latest.log. If it ever stops loading, the server has run out of memory, and \u0026ldquo;Part h\u0026rdquo; below should have a workaround.\nPart g: Backups # We should backup our minecraft server!\nEnsure there is a directory /home/minecraft/backups/, owned by the minecraft user.\nEnsure there is a script, /home/minecraft/backup.sh that is executable, with the following contents however you\u0026rsquo;d like.\n#!/bin/sh cp -r /home/minecraft/world \u0026#34;/home/minecraft/backups/world-$(date -Is)\u0026#34; The command copies the directory containing into the minecraft world into a subdirectory of backups indexed by the current date.\nUse puppet to add a cron entry to execute /home/minecraft/backup.sh every minute as the minecraft user.\nChecking Part g # Look in the /home/minecraft/backups contains backups!\nPart h: (Bonus, optional if you want Minecraft to not Out Of Memory) # We could be doing this by typing this a bunch of commands to add a swap file, and enabling it as swap, but we will do this puppet style!\nConfigure puppet to create a 4GB file /swapfile with the command dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=2M count=2048. Look through the flags to the exec resource to see how you can do this.\nNow configure Puppet to run mkswap /swapfile \u0026amp;\u0026amp; swapon /swapfile unless swap is currently active, which you can check by seeing if swapon -s | grep /swapfile returns a zero code. There are two arguments that can do this, unless or onlyif. Experiment to see which one works.\nChecking Part h # Run swapon -s, and check that /swapfile is listed. Ensure that there is no extranous output when you run puppet, if your checks are correctly done, this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen. Check /home/minecraft/logs/latest.log to make sure that the server has start up properly. If it has, then congratulations!\nPart i: (Bonus, running Minecraft) # Due to security issues, the Minecraft server running is only listening to 127.0.0.1, which means by default you can only access a Minecraft client running on the VM. You have two ways to get around this. One is changing server-ip in server.properties to a blank string (i.e. server-ip=), which will allow access by anybody. If you do this you probably want to set up a whitelist. The other option is SSH port forwarding. The command, if run on your machine, captures traffic at port 25565 on your local computer, and forwards them to port 25565 on your VM. The command will run forever, just leave it in the background while you try to connect.\nssh -NL 25565:localhost:25565 \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.decal.ocfhosted.com If you chose the first option, you can connect by typing your domain name (e.g. .decal.ocfhosted.com) or IP into minecraft, if you chose the second, you can connect to localhost.\nPart 3: Cleanup # There is currently a cronjob copying the minecraft world every minute. That might run you out of disk space. To disable that, you should run sudo crontab -e and remove the line for the backups.\nTrying to run a Minecraft Server constantly might also eat up some system resources. You can stop and disable the minecraft systmemd unit manually if it is causing issues.\nIf you added the swapfile, you might want to remove that.\nAnother way you can clean up is with puppet. By default, puppet doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove files it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about. However, you can use ensure =\u0026gt; absent to make sure files are gone, and similarly for the other resource types.\nPart 4: Submission # Congratulations on finishing the lab!\nTo submit, copy paste the code you have for each section into the gradescope submission.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/resources/","title":"Resources","section":"Home","content":" Reading/Resource List # Spring 2024\nLab Topic Reading 1 History of UNIX, Intro to Shell, FOSS Intro to Linux man page http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/intro.1.html\nFOSS licenses https://choosealicense.com/licenses/\nBasic terminal commands https://github.com/juanfrans/GSAPP-AP/wiki/Basic-Terminal-Commands\nResource: tldr is a nice tool for searching up commands https://tldr.inbrowser.app/\n2 Core Shell \u0026 Shell Scripting Core Shell\nCommand line shortcuts http://teohm.com/blog/shortcuts-to-move-faster-in-bash-command-line/\nHow to learn vim https://medium.com/actualize-network/how-to-learn-vim-a-four-week-plan-cd8b376a9b85\nTmux cheat sheet https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058\nShell Scripting\nBash reference manual https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction\nShell Tools and Scripting https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/\nBash Script Examples\nhttps://linuxhint.com/30_bash_script_examples/\n3 Packages FPM Documentation https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki\ndpkg man page https://linux.die.net/man/1/dpkg\napt man page https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt\nDevelopers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t distribute their own software by Drew DeVault\nRolling distribution releases versus periodic releases are a tradeoff by Chris Siebenmann\nPackage Management by the DebianWiki\npacman by ArchWiki\nDebian Packaging Tutorial.
