## Communication
Official course communications will primarily be sent via email and mirrored on the front page of the course website.

There are several ways you can get in contact with course facilitators:
1. Make a post on [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/42500/discussion/). (best for conceptual/debugging/content help)
2. Send a message to #decal-general (or as a private message to a facilitator) either on [Slack](https://ocf.io/slack) or [Discord](https://ocf.io/discord). (best for realtime communications)
3. Email [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu). (best for prospective students and matters that need to go on official record)

See the [about page](/about) for more information.
